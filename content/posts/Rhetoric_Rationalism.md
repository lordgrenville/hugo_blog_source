It's common to think of rhetoric as a gloss on top of 'true' thinking,
mere packaging for the intellectual content of our ideas. From some of
the Platonic dialogues it seems like rhetoric, (or *sophistry*, which
Plato made into an insult) is a foil to rational thought, an alternative
tradition which privileges aesthetic value - elegance of expression -
over content. (I seem to remember hearing a podcast \[probably [this
one](https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/05/14/ep76-deleuze/)\] about
how Deleuze and Guattari suggest that as a better criterion than Occam's
Razor for choosing a scientific explanation.)

In his book *Amusing Ourselves to Death* Neil Postman mentions this as a
possible difference between the media of oral and written culture: when
things are said, they must be constructed to be beautiful; when written,
people care more about how much sense they make.

There may be a similar idea with *mishna* and *gemara*: could this be
why the *gemara* so often reinterprets a pithy *mishna* to a clunky but
more consistent reading?

And of course the underlying, mischievous idea that one is not
necessarily better - they are just different forms of knowledge.
