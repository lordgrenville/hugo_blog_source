title: The Futility of Writing

Haven't written anything in a while, and so this post seems appropriate.
It seems sometimes like in the Internet age, everything has been said,
and it's mostly wrong. Take any news event in the last 24 hours, and you
will find on Twitter a vast panoply of opinions, taking every possible
perspective: joking, chiding, worrying, connecting it to the Grain Riots
of 1874. These will link to longer takes, rushing up like mushrooms
before the internet's atttention shifts and we forget all about it. I
tend to be cynical, but my cynicism is in every case pre-empted: and so
is any other position I might take. Considering how I might want to
respond, I'm confronted with the feeling that I won't be adding
anything, and so I usually refrain.

*Of making many books there is no end*, says Ecclesiastes. Today
everyone can publish everything and distribute everything they have to
say. In some ways this is good - more variety in media. It may have hurt
society in some ways, because when you remove all gatekeepers you give
equal weight to every crank and paranoiac. But it has also caused me to
doubt my interest in and love for the printed word. Lately I find myself
reading more maths, which for all its troubles, is a much calmer place
to be. I don't know if it's a long term solution.
