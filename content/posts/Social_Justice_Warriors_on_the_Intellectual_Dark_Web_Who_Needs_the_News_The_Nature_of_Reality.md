A very overdiscussed topic lately is political correctness, and if
there's too much of it. I propose the following three points:

1. At least some measure of socially ordained political correctness is
    unquestionably a good thing.
2. There is a point where social monitoring of offensive speech becomes
    intrusive, burdensome and overall not worthwhile.
3. 'PC Culture' is currently unevenly distributed - there are some
    places which have it in very high levels (many university campuses,
    say), whereas there are also plenty of places where some pretty
    offensive things are considered acceptable.

Basically my feeling is that there is a high level of variance among
people. Outside of the Western world there is a wild thicket of systems
of etiquette, views on race and caste and culture and gender, etc. And
even within the West, there is quite a lot of variance. I think this
variance is OK, a part of human nature. What the internet has changed is
that we see much more of each other's views, and have more opportunity
to take offence, such that people get angrier and more polarised. The
internet is less like a global village than like all the villages in the
world compressed into one physical space, haphazardly glimpsing each
other's business and getting offended.

I also suspect that a lot of people within places that have high levels
of PC aren't fully on board with the culture, but don't feel it's worth
taking on. I strongly endorse this hypothetical view, because a) this
doesn't seem like the biggest deal, and b) people's will probably
regress back to a calmer mean over time.

So the late, revered programmer Aaron Swartz, patron saint of the
Internet, has a [blog post](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews) I
categorically disagree with. Swartz argues that reading the news is
pointless because it doesn't affect your life, and that it is a form of
mindless entertainment.

By that logic, should you read news of scientific developments? It
affects your life very little, too, and it's unlikely that someone
outside of a very specialised field will be able to contribute. Why read
anything besides technical literature from your profession, and perhaps
investment advice? If one is going to read anything, it might as well be
keeping up with the world around you, and one might even be able to use
it to make small talk with other human beings.

I also think that this argument stems from a time when the media seemed
sturdier. Nowadays, the media business model is barely alive, and the
media's role in a democracy doesn't just work on its own. Swartz argues
that if the newspaper criticises the mayor, the mayor will apologise or
justify herself or whatever, so why does the reader need to get
involved? But nowadays the mayor has her own media. You could still
argue, as Swartz does, that one individual's opinion, or their vote,
doesn't really matter. But one might say in today's terms that that
argument "doesn't scale".

English speakers encountering the words for scientific things in other
languages often find them somewhat childlike, but that's only because
English obfuscates them with Latin and Greek, because tradition. Just
one example: TV in German is Fernsehen, "see-far"; in English it's the
same, but a hideous Greek-Latin hybrid. Leaving aside the Sapir-Whorff
hypothesis, it's beyond a doubt that the solidity of our language hides
an enormous amount of uncertainty. Not to get too Kantian, but in a
sense scientific models - not just of black holes and quantum particles,
but of all matter, consciousness, life! - are weird, hacky concepts,
leaky metaphors which partially describe observations of phenomena that
multiple people experience. I found this idea of the ubiquity and
fundamental nature of metaphor in human experience in a book I'm reading
([*The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral
Mind*](https://www.amazon.com/Origin-Consciousness-Breakdown-Bicameral-Mind/dp/0618057072)),
and I'll quote from it somewhat at length.
