An anecdote from Richard Rhodes' book *The Making of the Atomic Bomb*:

> Out of curiosity in 1940, while visiting Berkeley to deliver a
> lecture, Enrico Fermi attended a seminar one of \[J. Robert\]
> Oppenheimer's protégés led in the master's style. "Emilio," Fermi
> joked afterward with Segrè, "I am getting rusty and old. I cannot
> follow the highbrow theory developed by Oppenheimer's pupils anymore.
> I went to their seminar and was depressed by my inability to
> understand them. Only the last sentence cheered me up; it was: 'and
> this is Fermi's theory of beta decay.'" (p. 667)

If you're familiar with Menachot 29b, you'll see the parallel
immediately. In case you don't, I quote it here ([via
Sefaria](https://www.sefaria.org.il/Menachot.29b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en)):

> Moses said before God: Master of the Universe, show him to me. God
> said to him: Return behind you. Moses went and sat at the end of the
> eighth row in Rabbi Akiva's study hall and did not understand what
> they were saying. Moses' strength waned, as he thought his Torah
> knowledge was deficient. When Rabbi Akiva arrived at the discussion of
> one matter, his students said to him: My teacher, from where do you
> derive this? Rabbi Akiva said to them: It is a *halakha* transmitted
> to Moses from Sinai. When Moses heard this, his mind was put at ease,
> as this too was part of the Torah that he was to receive.
