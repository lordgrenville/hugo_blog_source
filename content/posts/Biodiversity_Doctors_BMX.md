I've been working at home this week, and leaving the windows open, as I like doing in all but the hottest weather. But I've been bothered by these guys on the right.

Googling mosquitoes with zebra-striped abdomens reveals that this is a [tiger mosquito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes_albopictus), an aggressive invader from SE Asia. Ranked as one of the hundred worst invasive species, it originally spread on packing crates and has penetrated most of the world, first being seen in Israel in 2003. And besides for worse things, such as being disease vectors, they are unusually awful pests: they hunt by day, unlike regular mozzies, and can easily adapt to living in almost any human habitat, not needing a humid bog. I can testify to their peculiarly aggressive nature, not minding being brushed away or swatted at, persisting until finding blood.

One of the side-effects of globalisation is the cross-pollination of nonhuman species all over the world, and simple Darwinism makes it likely that the strongest contenders from foreign environments will quickly take over many others (note the invasive Indian Mynahs and crows so prevalent here). It seems inevitable that this will result in a significant reduction in biodiversity. (The WWF claimed [in a report this week](https://qz.com/1443473/wwf-living-planet-report-says-humans-wiped-out-60-of-animals-since-1970/) that 60% of species had been wiped out since 1970.) This seems unpreventable, hard to track, and there might even be some unanticipated positive consequences. But it is a remarkable phenomenon.

A doctor recommended I have a mole taken out, so I went to a plastic surgeon, who said it was unnecessary, but he could do it anyway. "OK," I said. "OK what?" he asked, with typical Israeli patience. "Well, you say no, she says yes - how can I know what to do?" He waved his hand. "Don't worry about it, you can rely on me. It's the easiest thing to prescribe an op. That's not called being a doctor! Anyone could say that. It takes knowledge to say, it's not necessary." It reminded me a bit of doctrine of [כוחא דהיתרא עדיף](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%97_%D7%93%D7%94%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A3) (Beitza 2b) - anyone can prohibit something, but it takes a scholar to permit it!

On the way back from the doctor I walked past BMXers doing tricks outside the Cinematheque. What they do is unreal, Matrix stuff; it seems to override the law of gravity.
